	+Approval for support instance for online organization
	+Approval for DB copy for On-Premise instances	


**	What makes the problem worse or better?**
	+When did the issue start happening?
	+How many users are impacted?	


**	What's changed or new?**
	+What was done before the issue start happening?


**	Can I reduce the complexity?**


**	Has someone else already solved this problem?**
	+Do Google Search with the exact error message in Unify Global Search and Internet


**	Document the work: screenshots, logs, etc.**
	+Capture exact error message including the entire error stack.
	+Document the Kusto Query and Results/Verbose error logs
